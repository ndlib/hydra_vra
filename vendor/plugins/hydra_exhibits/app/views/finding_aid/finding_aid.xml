The notes were authorized by acts of February, May and October, 1733 to be partly used to exchange for notes from the issue of August 1732, and partly to be used to finance additional mortgage loans (as had been done in the August 1732 issue); finally the remainder of the issue was to be used to pay for public expenses. The issue was redeemable by May 1st of 1741. The front of the notes were engraved by Nathaniel Mors of Boston on two copper plates, while the backs were typeset by Timothy Green, who printed the issue. Notes printed after the October act were distinguished with the word Octo engraved on the face plate of each denomination. The larger plate (10s-&#xE03;5) was used again in 1735 for another issue, this time adding the date 1735 on the face of each denomination and completely resetting the typed backs. The front of each note displays the main text in a framed border with an image of an animal below. The animal differed on each denomination and was used as an aid by the illiterate. On the bottom left is the seal of the colony with three grape vines with the motto "QUI TRANSTULIT SUSTTINET" (What is transplanted survives). Denominations in this issue were: 2s, 2s6d, 3s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s and &#xE03;5.  </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>44</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Nathaniel Stanley, Hezekiah Wyllys, William Pitkin">Signers: Nathaniel Stanley, Hezekiah Wyllys, and William Pitkin.</persname></origination><unittitle label="3s">Three Shillings Fragment, one half of a note [?]44

The back half of a seated squirrel is seen to the right of the triangle. The full text on the obverse would have read as follows: &lt;Blockquote&gt;THREE CONNECTICUT 3s [serial number] 3s THIS BILL OF THREE Shillings Due from the Colony of Connecticut in New England; tp the Possessor thereof, Shall be in Value equal to MONEY and shall be accordingly accepted by the Treasurer and Receivers Subordinate to him and for any Stock at any Time in the Treasury Hartford, July ther Tenth in the Seventh Year of his MAJESTYS Teign Anno Dom: 1733 By Order of the General Court: Oc&lt;sup&gt;to&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/Blockquote&gt;I have not seen the full text for the reverse of this denomination, so I cannot reconstruct it as was done for the front (the front is based on a full example of the 1735 issued as pictured in Newman's fourth edition).

The scroll carries the abbreviated motto "QUI TRAN SUST" sometimes lacking the final N or final T (What is transplanted survives). In the border is: "SIGILLUM : COLON : CONNECTICENSIS" (Seal of the Colony of Connecticut). This form of the seal was on every emission from 1755 -1780. The October 1777 emission was signed and numbered in red ink and usually slash canceled upon redemption. Some were signed and registered on the blank back by the comptroller. Some were printed on white paper but the majority are on coarse blue paper with a combined emission for each demonination of 60,000 notes. The denominations printed were: 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d and 7d notes. </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>57</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Sam Squire">Signers: Sam Squire.</persname></origination><unittitle label="2d">Two Pence34961

For several of these emission the illustration was in the form of a colored circular seal with a Latin motto. These seals, which come in red, orange, green, blue-green, light blue and dark blue, were added to the bills after the sheets had been printed. Clearly this additional step was undertaken to make the simple typeset notes look more "official" and to enhance their acceptability. Of course, the seals would also make counterfeiting the notes more difficult (they also printed some words of the typeset notes in red ink to deter illegal printing), although this may not have been a major concern as there are no known counterfeits of Georgia typeset notes. The order of these emission cannot be reconstructed from currently available evidence, nor do we even know the quantity of most of these emissions. It is possible the issues without seals were printed earlier. These include the undated emission consisting of $3, $4, $5, $8 and $10 notes; a Gold Option emission consisting of a single $2 note and the sterling issue discussed below.

This pictograph technique was used often on colonial notes, but usually the crown was smaller and less conspicuous than in this example. While these certificates were being emitted in 1776, public sentiment held that the large crown image on this denomination had a royalist connotation. Production of 5s notes was temporarily halted as a result and the design was replaced with a light blue circular seal of a woman leaning against a table with the motto: "Sperandum" (One must hope). The "Sperandum" variety has a row of eight ornaments at the bottom. The numbering and three signatures are in brown ink.

The notes carry the date of May 31, 1710. This is the fifth Massachusetts emission and is one of the emissions that later was designated as "Old Tenor" notes. The plates used in the production of this emission were originally engraved by John Coney for the third Massachusetts emission, of November 21, 1702; these plates were later recut for the fifth emission so the year read 1708 (the 2 was changed to an 8). Some denominated were altered in the fifth emission and a red monogram AR (Anna Regina, which is Latin for Queen Anne) was added to the face of the notes. In this fifth emission the plates were more extensively altered with an entirely new date added to the text as well as altering some of the denominations. The denominations on the three original Coley plates were changed as follows: the lowest plate contained engravings printed a sheet with 2s, 2s6d, 3s and 3s6d notes; the middle plate printed a sheet with 4s, 5s, 10s, 20s notes; while the great plate printed a sheet with 40s, 50s, &#xE03;3 and &#xE03;5 notes. The middle and great plates were later used for the sixth Massachusetts emission in 1711, in this later issue the text was unaltered but the date 1711 was engraved in the blank space above the word Comtee (for Committee).  As in the third and fourth emissions the fifth emission contained a red scrollwork design on the top portion of the back of the note at the indent area. However in this emission the scrollwork was not added to the four lowest denominations (2s-3s6d) to deter alterations. From surviving examples of early notes we know individuals would take a low denomination note then erase the denomination and replace it by hand with a higher number, indeed one of the few surviving notes from the second Massachusetts emission of February 3, 1691 is a 20s note even though the emission only included notes of 2s, 2s6d, &#xE03;3 and &#xE03;6. It was hoped by excluding the scrollwork on low denomination notes in the fifth emission, individuals would have a more difficult time passing altered lower denomination notes. Another problem developed in that there were numerous counterfeit 20s notes in circulation from the third emission of November 21, 1702. By an act of November 4, 1710 all 20s notes from the third emission were recalled and &#xE03;15,000 in new 20s notes bearing the date of the May 31, 1710 emission were printed as replacements.  The issue was printed by John Allen in Boston on a rolling press constructed by John Brewer. In the lower left corner is the English shield of three lions with the French motto HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE (Evil to him who thinks evil) and the coronet of the Prince of Wales above. On each denomination the design of branches and leaves around the shield differs, with no design added to the shield on the 20s note. Denominations for the May 31, 1710 issue were: 2s, 2s6d, 3s, 3s6d, 4s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 50s, &#xE03;3 and &#xE03;5.  </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>134</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Samuel Sewall, Penn Townsend, John Clark">Signers: Samuel Sewall, Penn Townsend, John Clark.</persname></origination><unittitle label="20s">Twenty Shillings12[8]1

However in 1775 events required immediate independent and decisive measures be taken. Following the engagements at Lexington and Concord on the 19th of April, the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts attempted to raise an army. On May 20th the congress authorized an emission of &#xE03;25,998 in paper currency to be used as advance pay for recruits and known as "Soldier Notes" in contemporary legislative documents. These interesting notes were not only the first emission to be printed by Paul Revere but they were also the bills paid to those soldiers who, within a week or two of receiving these notes as pay, found themselves on Breed's Hill battling British regulars in what is now know as the Battle of Bunker Hill. (A WELL PRESERVED EXAMPLE FOLLOWS THIS INTRODUCTION).   The May 20th legislative authorization ordered a committee of Colonel Jedediah Foster, Major Eleazer Brooks and Dr. Samuel Holton to confer with the printer, Paul Revere on the specifics of the emission. The wording to appear on the notes and related details were finalized by the committee within five days. On the notes themselves the date is given as May 25, 1775.   It was decided that each soldier would be offered 20s in coin as advanced pay or, if they would accept it, they could take 40s in the newly printed notes, that could be redeemed for hard cash after May 25, 1776, with the bonus of 6% interest.   Clearly speed was paramount. By June 1st Henry Gardner, the Massachusetts Receiver General, stated he had several hundred notes ready to deliver and hoped to pay at least one regiment per day. On June 3rd Revere was asked: "...to attend the business of stamping the notes for the soldiers, all the ensuing night, if he can, and to finish them with the greatest despatch possible." Then on June 4th two members of congress were: "...appointed to attend Mr. Revere whilst he is striking off the notes for advance pay to the soldiers, night and day, till they are all struck off."   The notes were engraved from three copperplates, each plate printing a combination of denominations that added up to 40s per sheet. Clearly this was done so that each sheet would equal one soldier's pay. The plates are extant in the Massachusetts State Archives. One plate was used for the 18s, 12s and 10s notes, this was a cut down recycled plate that had originally been used on the other side for Revere's famous print of the Boston Massacre. Another copperplate was used for the 20s, 14s and 6s notes. Again this was a cut down reused plate that had a scene of Harvard College on the reverse. The final plate contained the 16s, 15s and 9s notes. Like the others this was a recycled plate, previously used for an engraving of Samuel Willard. These three plates were again reused for a small supplemental emission totaling &#xE03;3,748 on July 1, 1775, with only the date at the top of the notes being recut. The May date, to the right of the serial number was rubbed out and the July date was incised directly below the serial number (for the July 8th notes the May 25th date was retained in the body of the text!). Thus the extant plates now bear the July 1st date rather than the date of the much larger May 25th issue.   On June 5th three men were appointed to number the notes: John Pickering Jr. numbered notes struck from the first plate, Samuel Phillips numbered notes from the second plate and Ichabod Goodwin numbered notes from the third plate. Originally Abraham Fuller countersigned the notes but on June 2nd when he needed to attend to more pressing business Colonel Ezra Richmond was deputized to take his place. Then on the 5th of June, Colonel Jedediah Foster was appointed to assist with countersigning the sheets containing the 20s, 14s and 6s notes. On June 14th Samuel Thacher replaced Samuel Phillips and Colonel James Prescott replaced Colonel Foster. On June 16 (the Battle of Bunker Hill began that evening), Deacon Thomas Plympton replaced Colonel Richmond countersigning the smaller denomination notes.   Revere presented the Provincial Congress an invoice for the printing of the notes on June 22nd. This included the costs associated with the May 25th emission as well as the cost of printing a fiscal document, namely a receipt form, or what we would call a bond, used by the government to record money loaned to them at 6% interest. The total expenses were &#xE03;6 per plate for four plates (one for the bond and three for the soldier notes) and &#xE03;48 6s8d for printing at a rate of &#xE03;3 6s8d per thousand sheets, for a total bill of &#xE03;72 6s8d. On July 1st the congress decided to pay Revere &#xE03;50 for his services. The Provincial Congress was dissolved on July 19th and was replaced by a new House of Representatives. The House paid Revere for the July 8th and subsequent emissions at a fairer rate than he had obtained from the congress.   The May 25th emission consisted of indented bills having an acanthus leaf design on the left with the monogram MBC for Massachusetts Bay Colony. Below the design the note stated, "American Paper." The paper was watermarked with a crown over the initials G R for Georgius Rex, referring to King George III. The notes were completely engraved except for the handwritten serial number and signatures. Near the top, to the right of and just below the serial number, the day and year of issue appeared in white numbers on oval or rectangular black backgrounds that occur in different combinations on the various denomination. Redeemed notes were canceled by having x's placed over Gardner's signature or were hole punched (The example in the Massachusetts Historical Society has two holes punched along the upper border). The backs remained blank. There were 4,333 examples of each denomination printed except for the 6s and 20s which had 4,460 printed. Denominations printed were: 6s, 9s, 10s, 12s, 14s, 15s, 16s, 18s and 20s.   </scopecontent><odd>May 25, 1775- Soldier Notes</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>136</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Abraham Fuller, Henry Gardner">Signers: Abraham Fuller, Henry Gardner. </persname></origination><unittitle label="12s">Twelve Shillings3584

This was the first of four emissions of notes by Revere in his series featuring an American soldier on the back, often called the "Sword in hand" issues. In this August emission approximately 10,000 bills were issued for each denomination and were to be redeemable in "Lawfull Money" by one of three specified dates. A total of &#xE03;40,000 was printed with a redemption date of August 18, 1778, another &#xE03;30,000 with the date of August 18, 1779 and the final &#xE03;30,000 was dated August 18, 1780. Some 17s and 24s notes were printed with the incorrect date of 1777, which was corrected to 1778 (some were corrected by hand before the plate was fixed). However, bills of 6s or higher from emissions before November 1776 were recalled for exchange by an act of October 13, 1777, which was amended three times, successively extending the date for redemption until December 1, 1778, at which time the notes became invalid and unredeemable.  This was the first emission of Massachusetts printed currency for public use since 1750. Revere's two earlier emissions of large sized engraved notes, of May 25th and July 8th, 1775 were authorized only for advanced pay for soldiers, hence they were called "soldier money" in contemporary sources. Once the soldiers were paid the Massachusetts Provincial Congress turned to the problem of paying a mounting public debt associated with expenses related to the war as well as tackling the problem of providing currency for daily business transactions. On July 6, 1775 the Committee of Safety recommended the Provincial Congress issue &#xE03;100,000 in public notes. However the Congress was dissolved on July 19; but the matter quickly surfaced in the newly formed House of Representatives, which met in Watertown. On July 27th a committee report favoring the emission was brought to the House with the suggestion that a variety of denominations from one to forty shilling be printed. By August 4th the House procured the services of Revere while the final act authorizing the emission was passed on August 23rd, however the date on the notes is August18th, possibly the date the resolution was brought to the House.   There were sixteen denominations in this issue printed from the two sets of newly engraved copper plates. The front of each note has a small oval vignette with a ship docked at a harbor or a tree; the design differs on each denomination. The back depicts a colonial American soldier (sometimes called a minuteman) with a sword in his right hand and copy of the Magna Charta in his left. This is a document signed by King John in 1215, popularly interpreted as conferring rights to all free Englishmen. Above is the motto "Issued in defence of American Liberty" and below is the motto of Massachusetts "Ense petit placidam sub Libertate Quietem" usually translated as: By the sword she seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty. The motto was taken from an annotation written by Algernon Sidney, "Manus haec inimica tyrannis / Esne petit placidam sub libertate quietam" translated as: This hand is an enemy to tyrants / with the sword it seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty (see: &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 51, 1917-18, pp. 259-82). The copper plate used to print the front of the lower denominations (1s-8s) is extant in the Massachusetts State Archives; however as it was extensively modified for the second emission of December 7, 1775 it is discussed under that emission. Also, the plate for the back of the higher denominations does survive, but as it was modified for the final emission of this series, dated November 17, 1776, it is discussed under that emission.   Revere appears to have work on this emission throughout September. The notes were needed as quickly as possible but it appears it was difficult to get the requisite number of committee men together to sign them. On September 22nd it appears 1,000 of the lower denomination sheets had been signed by two members of the committee and on that date it was ordered the remaining 9,000 sheets were to be signed by any one committee member. Likewise 4,000 of the higher denomination sheets (10s-40s) had previously been signed by three members of the committee and it was ordered the remaining 6,000 sheets were to be signed by only two members. All the bills were printed by October 17th for on that day the plates were placed in a chest and sent to the Treasurer's office. Finally, on October 20, 1775 Revere was paid &#xE03;133 6s8d for making the plates, providing the supplies and printing the notes. Denominations for the December 7, 1775 issue were: 1s, 2s, 2s6d, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s6d, 8s, 10s, 11s, 12s, 17s, 20s, 24s, 30s and 40s.   </scopecontent><odd>August 18, 1775- Sword in Hand</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>137</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="J.

One half of the bills of each denomination were payable in "Lawfull Money" from the treasury by June 18, 1778 and the other half by June 18, 1779. Bills under $1 in value were typeset and had denominations in shillings and pence. Bills of $1 (i.e. 6s) and over had three border cuts on the front along with an oval vignette derived from Paul Revere's "Sword in hand" issues, showing an American soldier holding a sword in his right hand and the Magna Charta in his left (actually it is a scroll labelled MC or MA CA). This is a document signed by King John in 1215, popularly interpreted as conferring rights to all free Englishmen. The back was rather simple consisting of only the typeset spelling of the denomination with a two line border above and below. Denominations of $1 and above were called in for exchange by acts of October 13, 1777 and December 13, 1777. Lower denomination issues were recalled by an act of October 13, 1778 (to be exchanged for the "Codfish" bills of October 16, 1778). All bills were printed on coarse paper by Benjamin Edes. Edes and John Gill published the radical anti-British newspaper, The Boston Gazette and Country Journal.

The counterfeit can be differentiated from the original as follows: the counterfeit lacks a comma between SHILLINGS and L.M., which is found in the legal issue. Also, the bottom of the J in June is missing and the letter is positioned directly over the ascender of the d in received located on the line below, while in the original the bottom hook of the J is visible and the letter is to the right of the ascender of the d in received. In the date 1779 on the same line, in the counterfeit the 1 is directly above the final t in the word "that" from the line below while the S in Sum is aligned in the space between the straight descending strokes of the 7's in 77 of the date, while in the legal issue the 1 is to the right of the final t and the S is to the left of the bottom stroke of the first 7 in 77. On the back, in this counterfeit example, the top border lines are shorter than the bottom borders, while on originals both borders are long. From this issue counterfeits are known for the 2s6d, 4s4d, 5s and $4 (24s) denominations. In the text L.M. refers to Lawful Money.

This emission was authorized by legislation approved on September 16th, which was enacted on the following day, September 17th. This was the third of four emissions of notes by Revere in his series featuring an American soldier on the back, often called the "Sword in hand" issues. Approximately 4,630 bills were issued for each denomination in this emission and were redeemable in "Lawfull Money" on December 7, 1781. However this emission as well as all bills of 6s or higher from previous emissions were recalled for exchange by an act of October 13, 1777, which was amended three times, successively extending the date for redemption until December 1, 1778, at which time the notes became invalid and unredeemable.  The front of each note has a small oval vignette with a ship docked at a harbor or a tree; the design differs on each denomination. The back depicts a colonial American soldier (sometimes called a minuteman) with a sword in his right hand and a copy of the Declaration of Independence in his left. Above is the motto "Issued in defence of American Liberty" and below is the motto of Massachusetts "Ense petit placidam sub Libertate Quietem" usually translated as: By the sword she seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty. The motto was taken from an annotation written by Algernon Sidney, "Manus haec inimica tyrannis / Esne petit placidam sub libertate quietam" translated as: This hand is an enemy to tyrants / with the sword it seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty (see: &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 51, 1917-18, pp. 259-82).   The copper plates were the same ones used for the earlier issues of this series but with some significant alterations. Naturally, for each emission the dating was modified by rubbing out the date etched into the copper plate and replacing it with the proper date for the new emission. But, as this was the first emission following the Declaration of Independence, which had been signed on July 4th, a more substantial modification was required. For this issue the word "Colony" on the front of the notes (appearing twice) was rubbed out and replaced with "State". As early as September 10th (six days before the emission was authorized) the House ordered Oliver Wendell to: "wait on Mr. Revere, to desire him to alter the word Colony, in the plate on which the bills of credit are to be struck off, and insert State in the room thereof." With the authorizing of the issue on the 16th a committee of signers was formed and on the 18th Captain Johathan Brown was asked to bring back paper for emission from the paper mill of Vose, Lewis and Crane in Milton to Watertown, where the House of Representatives was meeting. (Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts,1886, vol. 5, page 559 and the House Journal, pp. 93-97, 108-109 and 112).   For this and the fourth emission of Sword in hand issues only the higher denomination notes from 10s through 48s were produced. One set of front and back copper plates, used in the previous emissions, were modified and used for this issue to produce sheets with an example of each of the eight different denominations. The copper plate for the back of these notes is extant in the Massachusetts State Archives. As it was further modified for the fourth issue of November 17, 1776, it is discussed in that section.   Paul Revere's original invoice for the printing of the September and the November emissions is preserved in the Chamberlain Collection in the Boston Public Library. Next to the date Sep 27 is a charge for &#xE03;41 3s1 and 1/2d for printing a total of 37,040 bills at 2d Old Tenor per bill. The invoice was submitted on December 30, 1776 and Revere was paid by the state on January 2, 1777.   Denominations for the September 17, 1775 issue were: 10s, 14s, 16s, 22s, 28s, 36s, 42s and 48s </scopecontent><odd>September 17, 1776- Sword in Hand</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><daogrp><daoloc href=""/></daogrp></c01><c01 level="item"><did><unitid identifier="MA10.18.76">MA 10/18/76</unitid><origination><persname role="printer">John Gill</persname><persname role="engraver"></persname></origination><unittitle><unitdate era="ce" calendar="gregorian">Massachusetts Currency October 18, 1776</unitdate><imprint><geogname></geogname><publisher>Massachusetts</publisher></imprint>October 18, 1776</unittitle><physdesc/></did><scopecontent>An emission of &#xE03;75,000 in legal tender bills of credit payable in lawful money from the state treasury by October 18, 1784, however bills of 6s or higher were recalled for exchange by an act of October 13, 1777, which was amended three times, successively extending the date for redemption until December 1, 1778, at which time the notes became invalid and unredeemable.  On October 10,1776 the Massachusetts House of Representatives appointed a committee to draft legislation for an emission of &#xE03;75,000 in legal tender bills of credit. By October 19th the legislation had been read three times in the House and was sent to the Council for further action. However the Council did not vote on the legislation until December 6, 1776 when the bill was passed; it was enacted the following day December 7th. The emission provided for twenty four different denominations, including several small change notes under a shilling. Thus, although this emission is dated as October it was authorized after the November 17th emission and was printed in December by John Gill at the same time Revere was printing the first installment of the November emission.   Work on the emission actually preceeded the November issue (which was authorized on October 29th). Apparently the House committee, formed on October 10th, began work on the project before the act had passed the Council. They had stated the front of the notes were to be engraved in copper plate "...with a handsome border" while the back of the notes was to be typeset "with suitable ornament." They even went so far as to obtain the services of Nathaniel Hurd to engrave the plates. Apparently Hurd had more work that he could handle for on November 6, 1776 Col. Azar Orne was added to the emission committee in order to expedite the completion of the plates. The House record continues, "...if the committee shall think proper, they take the plate from Mr. Hurd, and employ some other person to compleat the same." After a few weeks on investigation it was decided on November 27: "That the committee appointed to cut plates for a new emission of money, take from Mr. Hurd the plates he began to engrave, and deliver the same to Mr. Revere, to be compleated." (House Journal, pp. 116, 127, 145, 175; Acts and Resolves, 1886, vol 5, pp. 610 and 693).   The lower denominations from 2d through 4s6d featured an engraved front with a codfish at the top and columns on the sides and one signature below. The back included Nathaniel Hurd's cast cut of a pine tree and a typeset text by John Gill. The higher denominations, 6s to 72s featured an engraved front with each side displaying an ornate column with a urn on the top and two signatures below. The back included three border cuts with a codfish in the top margin and a center cut of a pine tree surrounded by the Latin quote, "Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci" (He has won universal approval who has combined the useful with the agreeable). The phrase is from the Ars poetica of Horace, line 343. It was adapted on the Rosa Americana coppers of 1722-1724 as well as on the masthead of the Essex Gazette (published in Salem, Massachusetts) from 1768-71. The back of these higher denomination notes also contain some typeset text by John Gill. The notes were printed by John Gill in Boston, there were 5,143 bill printed of each of the smaller denominations and 3,000 each for notes of 6s and above. John Gill was a well known patriot and printer in Boston. Gill and Benjamin Edes published the radical anti-British newspaper, The Boston Gazette and Country Journal. The Journal's office was the meeting spot for the members of the Boston Tea Party just before they went to Boston harbor.   It appears the engraving was completed in November, before the emission had been authorized by the Council. There were two copper plates, one for the front of the smaller denominations and another for the front of the larger denominations. Both Hurd and Revere worked on these at different times. The engraved cuts added to the back of the notes are usually attributed to Hurd as the tree on the lower denominations is quite similar to the tree Hurd used on the lottery payment certificates he engraved for the state treasury (Anderson, MA-15). Click here to view an example. For further information on the certificates see the Massachusetts lottery section. Revere submitted his charges to the House on December 2nd and Nathaniel Hurd followed with an invoice for his fee on December 7th.

This was the second of four emissions of notes by Revere in his series featuring an American soldier on the back, often called the "Sword in hand" issues. In this December emission approximately 6,250 bills were issued for each denomination and were to be redeemable in "Lawfull Money" on December 7, 1781. However bills of 6s or higher from emissions before November 1776 were recalled for exchange by an act of October 13, 1777, which was amended three times, successively extending the date for redemption until December 1, 1778, at which time the notes became invalid and unredeemable.  Fifteen of the sixteen denominations in this issue differed from the sixteen denominations in the first emission of the series, issued about four months earlier in August. Only the 10s denomination is common to both emissions. Nevertheless, the two sets of plates used to print the notes were the same ones used for the previous issue of August 18, 1775 but with alterations to reflect the new date of issue and the differing denominations.   In a letter Revere wrote to the Massachusetts House of Representatives on December 8, 1775 he agreed to:   "Engrave the Plates &amp; make the necessary alterations in the same ... As the alteration &amp; engraving will not be quite so much work as the last [referring to the first Sword in Hand emission of August 18], I agree to alow [sic] thirty Shillings L. [Lawful] Money out of the whole." The letter had been written from Watertown, where the legislature was meeting and apparently was quickly delivered and immediately acted upon, for on the same day, December 8th, the House resolved:  "That Henry Gardner Esquire; Receiver General of this Colony be, and hereby is directed to deliver unto Mr. Paul revere, Engraver, the two Pair of Copper-Plates, now in the keeping of said Receiver General, from which the last Emission of Bills was struck off; one Pair of said Plates to be delivered upon the return of the other, and that Mr. Revere be directed to proceed with all expedition, in the cutting or engraving a New Sett of Plates for the striking off Bills of public Credit, ... And that he be allowed for said Service One Penny and a Half Penny O.T. [Old Tenor] for each Bill he shall strike off, he finding the Paper, and every Material that shall be necessary, and allowing a deduction to be made from the forgoing Allowance of the Sum of Thirty Shillings Lawful-Money for the Advantage he will receive from the old Plates ..." [House Journal, p. 28]. The copper plate used to print the front of the 8d-7s denominations is extant in the Massachusetts State Archives, unfortunately the plate for the back of these notes is lost. The plate used for the front of 10s-48s denominations was further modified and reused for the final two emissions of this series and has not survived. However, the plate for the back of the higher denominations does survive. As it was modified for the final emission of this series, dated November 17, 1776, it is discussed under that emission. Also, a copper plate for the front of a counterfeit 42s note of the December 7th emission survives in the Montrose Natural History and Antiquarian Society, Montrose, Scotland. That plate now has a hole in the oval where the serial number would be written.   As on the first emission, the front of each note has a small oval vignette with a ship docked at a harbor or a tree; the design differs on each denomination. The back depicts a colonial American soldier (sometimes called a minuteman) with a sword in his right hand and copy of the Magna Charta in his left. This is a document signed by King John in 1215, popularly interpreted as conferring rights to all free Englishmen. Above is the motto "Issued in defence of American Liberty" and below is the motto of Massachusetts "Ense petit placidam sub Libertate Quietem" usually translated as: By the sword she seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty. The motto was taken from an annotation written by Algernon Sidney, "Manus haec inimica tyrannis / Esne petit placidam sub libertate quietam" translated as: This hand is an enemy to tyrants / with the sword it seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty (see: &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 51, 1917-18, pp. 259-82). Denominations for the December 7, 1775 issue were: 8d, 1s4d, 1s6d, 2s8d, 3s, 3s4d, 4s6d, 7s, 10s, 14s, 16s, 22s, 28s, 36s, 42s and 48s.   </scopecontent><odd>December 18, 1775- Sword in Hand</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>143</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Joseph Wheeler">Signers: Joseph Wheeler (others faded). </persname></origination><unittitle label="3s4d">Three Shillings, Four Pence5481 (?)

This emission was combined from two acts, on October 29, 1776 a total of &#xE03;50,004 in bills was authorized. This was the original act for which Revere prepared the plates; however it was supplemented by an act of December 6, 1776 which provided for an additional &#xE03;20,034 in bills to be printed using the same plates with the November 17, 1776 date. Together, this two part emission, was the fourth and final emission of notes by Revere in his series featuring an American soldier on the back, often called the "Sword in hand" issues. Approximately 6,485 bills were issued for each denomination in this emission and were redeemable in "Lawfull Money" on December 7, 1781. However this emission as well as all bills of 6s or higher from previous emissions were recalled for exchange by an act of October 13, 1777, which was amended three times, successively extending the date for redemption until December 1, 1778, at which time the notes became invalid and unredeemable.  The front of each note has a small oval vignette with a ship docked at a harbor or a tree; the design differs on each denomination. The back depicts a colonial American soldier (sometimes called a minuteman) with a sword in his right hand and a copy of the Declaration of Independence in his left. Above is the motto "Issued in defence of American Liberty" and below is the motto of Massachusetts "Ense petit placidam sub Libertate Quietem" usually translated as: By the sword she seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty. The motto was taken from an annotation written by Algernon Sidney, "Manus haec inimica tyrannis / Esne petit placidam sub libertate quietam" translated as: This hand is an enemy to tyrants / with the sword it seeks peaceful tranquility under liberty (see: &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 51, 1917-18, pp. 259-82).   The copper plates were the same ones used for the earlier issues of this series but with some significant alterations. Naturally, for each emission the dating was modified by rubbing out the date etched into the copper plate and replacing it with the proper date for the new emission. With the third emission of this series, on September 17, 1776, the word "Colony" on the front of the notes (appearing twice) was rubbed out and replaced with "State". In the present fourth emission the plates were further altered. In all previous emissions the document held by the soldier on the reverse read, "MAGNA CHARTA" referring to the document signed by King John in 1215, popularly interpreted as conferring rights to all free Englishmen. For this final emission, printed some four months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the wording on the document was rubbed off and replaced with "Independance." The misspelling is found on all denominations and is usually divided in two lines Indepen/dance except on the 28s note where it is in three lines. The copper plate for the back of these notes is extant in the Massachusetts State Archives. It was the reused reverse side of the plate originally used for Revere's large print issued in 1770, "A View of Part of the Town of Boston in New-England and British Ships of War Landing their Troops! 1768."   Paul Revere's original invoice, containing the charges for both the September and November emissions, is preserved in the Chamberlain Collection in the Boston Public Library. Next to the date Nov'r 17 is a charge for &#xE03;8 "To engraving two plates anew" (refering to the modifications made to the plates for the November issue) and for &#xE03;41 3s1 and 1/2d for printing 37,040 bills at 2d Old Tenor per bill. This reflected only the first part of the November emission authorized on October 29th. The invoice was submitted on December 30, 1776 and Revere was paid by the state on January 2, 1777. I assume the December 6th supplement had not been completed and that another invoice, that has not survived, was submitted at a later date for the 14,840 notes printed as the second part of this emission.   Denominations for the December 7, 1775 issue were the same as in the third issue: 10s, 14s, 16s, 22s, 28s, 36s, 42s and 48s. In this issue the only denomination with a known counterfeit is the 48s note.   </scopecontent><odd>November 17, 1776- Sword in Hand</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>146</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Ichabod Goodwin (forgery)">Signers: Ichabod Goodwin (forgery). </persname></origination><unittitle label="48s(CF)">Forty Eight Shillings Counterfeit1206

See the general discussion above for difference between this emission and prior emissions in this series. This example is a well preserved contemporary counterfeit of the 48s note. The counterfeiter made a very close copy with only the following small differences from the legal issue. On the front in the corners the bottom of the 4 in the denomination is slightly higher that the bottom of the 8. Also, in the vignette the counterfeit lacks the fine lines representing ropes extending from the mast poles down to the deck, which are found on the originals. Finally, on the front the right border is 87mm from the top of the design to the bottom of the 8 while the left border is 89mm. There are no noticeable differences from the originals on the back.

Paul Revere's copper plates for the front side of the bills in the October 18, 1776 emission were redated and used for this issue. Apparently he printed the face of these notes. Also, Nathaniel Hurd's cast cuts of a pine tree made for the back side of the October 1776 issue were reused. However since the back of this issue was printed by Thomas Fleet (the earlier issue had been printed by John Gill) different type and border designs were used. The Massachusetts Historical Society has a restrike of the reverse plate that is autographed, "Presented by Mr. Thomas Fleet the printer 14 Septem 1799." The October 1778 act originally provided for the printing of &#xE03;28,000 of notes. However in an act passed on January 13, 1779 it was stated, "the copper plates are found insufficient for stamping the number of bills required." Clearly the used plates were worn out. Thus &#xE03;20,000 was to be forwarded to the next emission. This would be Revere's final currency project, the 1779 "Rising Sun" emission. Denominations issued in this October 16th emission were: 2d, 3d, 4d, 6d, 8d, 9d, 12d (1s), 1s6d, 2s, 3s, 4s and 4s6d.  </scopecontent><odd>October 16, 1778- Codfish</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>147</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="George Patridge">Signer: George Patridge.</persname></origination><unittitle label="4s">Four Shillings2076

The front of these bills was made from a newly created plate by Paul Revere depicting the sun rising. On each denomination the scene and borders are slightly different. Apparently Revere printed only the front of the bills. The back was typset by Thomas Fleet in Boston reusing the cast cuts of the pine tree previously used for the October 18, 1776 and October 16, 1778 issues. Revere's original copper plate, with the front of all twelve denominations survives in the Massachusetts State Archives. The American Antiquarian Society and the Massachusetts Historical Society both have restrikes of the plate. The Historical Society also has a presentation proof copper plate of the printed back of all twelve denominations. On the back of the plate is written "Presented to Mr. Thomas Fleet the printer 14 Septem. 1799." Also, the Chamberlain Collection in the Boston Public Library has Revere's handwritten bill to the state for &#xE03;713 6s8d for the engraving and printing of this issue.

The was the first New Hampshire issue of new tenor notes, which were valued at 6s8d per troy ounce of sterling silver (which was equal to 5s2d in British silver coinage). This was equal to four times the value of old tenor notes, therefore on the back of each note was the denomination in both old and new tenor; for example, 40s or &#xE03;2 new tenor was equal to &#xE03;8 in old tenor bills. An additional quantity of &#xE03;1,280 in notes were printed with this press run but were held in reserve until being issued under an act of September 28, 1743.  The two plates for this emission were engraved in Boston by Thomas Johnston, who also printed the notes. The plates were then used for an emission authorized on April 3, 1742 for mortgage loans with the notes valued at 8s per troy ounce of sterling silver (but without changing the rate on the plates). This emission was approved by the Lords of Trade and Plantations in Britain on June 2, 1743 therefore the date 1743 was added to the plates just above the signature area, usually to the right of the center just below the frame around the text.  Also the letter L was added to each engraving. The plates were then used for the February 1744/45 emission with the date of February 1744 added to the obverse of each note, somewhere below the central text, usually just below the central frame, toward the left margin. Additional quantities of notes were printed without any further redating of the plates for the following three issues: an emission of &#xE03;6,000 by an act of July 6, 1745; an emission of &#xE03;8,000 by an act of October 5, 1745 and finally a large emission of &#xE03;60,000 was authorized to finance an expedition into Canada by an act of July 12, 1746. During this period the value of sterling silver continued to rise so that by 1745 it was 8s9d per troy ounce. Notes from the February 1744/45 through the July 12, 1746 emissions cannot be distinguished. The dating 1744/45 refers to the situation that at that time the British celebrated the New Year in March so the date on the notes "February 1744" is converted to February 1745 using our current calendar. Denominations for the April 3, 1742 issue include: 6d, 1s, 2s6d, 6s, 7s6ds, 10s, 20s and 40s.   </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>162</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="">Signers: missing. </persname></origination><unittitle label="40s">Forty Shillings (fragment)</unittitle><physdesc><dimensions>Size: fragment 103 x 78mm.</dimensions></physdesc></did><scopecontent>This is a torn fragment of the top one third of a note. The portion that remains is in very fine condition, indeed the front shows much of the top border, a section completley missing from the example plated by Newman (4th edition, p. 229). This fragment has been attributed to the original April 3, 1742 emission as there is no letter L on the note. The Newman plate of the 1743 redated variety has an L above the word Shillings at the top, the L is found on all denominates of reuses of the plate. Except for this added letter the specific emission of this note cannot be confirmed as the portion with the dating (and redating) is lost. With the exception of the added L the text visible on this fragment was the same as was printed on all emissions from April 3, 1742 to July 12, 1746. On the front the frame around the central text consists of acanthus leaves and flowers. From more complete examples the full text can be reconstructed: "PROVINCE OF NEW=HAMPSHIRE / 40.s Forty Shillings 40.s / This Bill of Forty Shillings due / to the Possessor thereof from ye province / of NEW-HAMPSHIRE shall be equal to Six Ounces of coin'd / Silver Troy Weight of Sterling Alloy, or / Gold Coin at ye Rate of Four Pounds / Eighteen Shillings pr Ounce, and shall be / so accepted in all payments and in the / TREASURY. PORTSMOUTH Apr. 3d 1742 / By Order of ye GENERAL / COURT or ASSEMBLY." Note that the O and F in the top line are separated on either side of the shell. The back of this example has much of the cartouche remaining. The face at the top is more distinct that in the Newman plate. Within this frame is the the old and new tenor equivalency but with a large ink stain, the text reads "Eight / Pounds. / Old Tenor. / Forty / Shillings" [that is, 40s New Tenor]. </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>12 o'clock (page turn)</genreform></controlaccess><acqinfo>Purchased through the Robert H.

This is the first New York emission. On May 24, 1709 a tax of &#xE03;6,000 was authorized to fund a military expedition to Canada under Captains Robert Walters, Lawrence Reade, John DePeyster and Robert Lurting. On June 8, 1709 an act was passed to issue a total of &#xE03;5,000 in Bills of Credit, pursuant to the funds authorized on May 24. The June 8th act stated the notes would be acceptable for taxes and other public payments to the treasury and that they were to be dated May 31st. Most likely the legislation was written on that day and the May 31st dating was never changed to reflect the actual date on which the act was passed. The notes were typeset by William Bradford with a wood cut design for the indent. Each sheet consisted of four notes printed on their side with the indent to the left edge. A committee of any three of the four captains were authorized to sign the notes. Denominations issued in this emission were: 5s (in two varieties, one with "&amp;" for the word "and," the other with the word "and" spelled out but having an inverted d), 10s (in two varieties, one with Governor another with Governour), 20s, 40s and &#xE03;5.  Three other colonies followed New York authorizing their initial paper money emissions in 1709 as follows: July 1, 1709 - New Jersey; July 12, 1709 - Connecticut and on December 5, 1709 - New Hampshire.  </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>200</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Robert Walter, Johannes DePeyster, Robert Lurting">Signers: Robert Walter, Johannes DePeyster, Robert Lurting </persname></origination><unittitle label="10s">Ten Shillings3368

This is the first paper currency emitted by a city in colonial America. All previous general emissions had been issued by the authority of a colony. Within a year Albany had issued currency (on June 22, 1775) and a second "Water Works" emission had been issued. Later, in 1786 Charleston, S.C. issued currency, then during the copper panic of the 1790's several cities issued small denomination bills. However, it should be remembered that privately printed bank and merchant notes date back much earlier as the notes Benjamin Franklin printed in June of 1729 for the Philadelphia shopkeeper Evan Morgan. A significant number of private issues continue throughout the colonial and confederation periods.  This issue is known as the Water Works Issue because the back of each note has an engraving of a steam powered water pump proposed by the engineer Christopher Colles. The front of the bills has an engraved top border cut while the other three borders are typeset. In this series the first emission and part of the second water works emission have backs with white paper. A large portion of the second emission and all of the third and fourth emissions have white paper on the front but a dark coarse paper on the back of the notes. The plates were engraved by Elisha Gallaudet, who also cut the borders and devices for the Continental Congress "fugio" denominations of February 17, 1776 and cut the dies for the so called "1776 Continental Congress Dollar." The Water Works emissions were printed by Hugh Gaine in New York City with red and black inks on the face and black ink on the back. Notes were signed and numbered in brown and black inks. Denominations issued in this emission were: 1s, 2s, 4s and 8s. These denominations had not been issued in the colony of New York since November 16, 1726.   </scopecontent><odd>August 25, 1774- NYC</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>210</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Whitehead Hicks, J.

Earlier 14 coppers were valued at a shilling but during the height of the panic it took 60 coppers to equal a shilling (if you could find someone willing to take the coppers!). In response to this "copper panic" municipalities, banks and churches printed their own small change notes. This is an example of Church money issued by the trustees of the Presbyterian Congregational Church of Troy, New York in Rensselaer County. This was done so the church would not be "stuck" with worthless coppers. One would purchase these notes at the church using silver coins or higher denomination currency at what had been the standard rate (say 14d to the shilling), then one could give their weekly contribution to the church (of one or two pence) without resorting to the worthless coppers. The notes were typeset by C.R. and G. Webster of Albany. At first these notes were signed by Morgan as treasurer while later notes were signed by B. Gorton as treasurer.

On the front is a seal (46mm) depicting a woman seated at the water's edge.  She is covered in a wrap to protect her from the rain that is coming down. She watches in the distance as the sun comes out over a town at the other shore. In this context it appears the image was to signify the light after a storm. The image of the sun coming out after a storm or rising over a new nation became a popular theme on revolutionary currency (the MA 1779 emission and the CC $7 note are just a few of the numerous examples). This is a very early use of that imagery, just six weeks after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. One wonders if during the war some holders of this currency may have interpreted the image as Britannia looking over the Atlantic at America? Around the seal is the motto: "POST TENEBRAS LUX" (After darkness there is light) with the date 1775 below. Click here to view a detail of the seal. The engraved back is oriented vertically, with designs and a scroll bearing the motto "For the public good." There are handwritten annotation on the back: Symthe Feloud to GES at Mr. Alegs (?). In the upper left are the initials: J.M., J.C. and E.D. In the lower left are the numbers 34 over 17 5.

This is the only emission issued by Vermont. The bills were redeemable by June 1, 1781 at the rate of 6s in bills for a Spanish milled dollar or its equivalent in gold. After that date their legal tender status was revoked but they could still be used to pay taxes. Redeemed bills were burned. The engraved seal on the face shows 13 linked circles with one unlinked circle at the top. This, of course, represents Vermont which was not included as one of the original 13 colonies. The motto around the seal reads "VERMONT CALLS FOR JUSTICE." The front and back have engraved border cuts with typeset text. The notes were printed in Westminster by Judah P.

This was also the first emission to include the newly redesigned state arms, which appears on left showing Liberty as a soldier triumphant over her foe. A crude counterfeit of this four dollar denomination exists.

The money, for "The United Colonies", was to be used to pay war expenses and was to be redeemed from taxes collected by the colonies. The paper, made at Ivy Mills in Chester County, Pennsylvania, contained blue fibers and mica flakes and was similar to the type used on Pennsylvania currency. The exception was the unique $20 denomination which was printed on paper made by Benjamin Franklin (thin white paper that had the left side polychromed by marbling). This bill is also a different size from the other denominations. The bills were printed by Hall and Sellers in Philadelphia using border cuts, emblem cuts, nature prints and hand set type. Apparently, thirty six of the borders were designed and cut by David Rittenhouse. The bills were signed with red and brown ink and numbered in dark red ink. Counterfeit detectors were on pink paper except for the $20, which was on blue paper.

Most colonial and confederation era paper currency is aligned so that the back is either properly displayed or to one side when the note is turned with a "medal turn" (that is, like turning a page in a book). All notes on this website display the small images with the reverse displayed as it would appear following a medal turn. this was done so the alighment of the front and back can be easily determined. This special issue and denomination note is aligned in the manner of a "coin turn" hence I displayed the reverse upside down on the smaller image as that is the orientation if one flips the note from the left or right side (as in a medal turn). Simply click the small image to see the large image of the reverese properly oriented.The emblem on the front shows a strong wind creating waves on the ocean with the motto "Vi concitatae" (It assults with a violent force). On the back is a emblem with the shining sun and ships on a calm sea with the motto "Cessante vento conquiescemus" (When the wind subsides we shall rest). Newman has discovered a preliminary sketch for the front emblem in the papers of Benjamin Franklin (see his third edition p. 53). The $20 bill from this first emission was unique in that it was a different size from all other continental currency and was made on different paper. It was printed by Hall and Sellers on a thin white paper with a marbled left border that had been made by Benjamin Franklin. Unlike the other bills they were printed individually rather than in sheets. Also, since this note was the only Contenental Congress not that did not include border cuts, it was the only Continental Congress variety that did not include the phrase "The United Colonies" (later changed to "The United States"). </scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>6 o'clock</genreform></controlaccess><acqinfo>Purchased through the Robert H.

Of this $1,000,000 was reserved for the first national fractional currency. The front design on the fractional notes includes the first use of the "FUGIO" (I fly) legend and sundial as well as the "Mind your Business" legend. The back shows the thirteen linked rings representing the colonies and the legends "We are one" and "American Congress". Eric Newman has discovered these designs were created by Benjamin Franklin (see his indispensable The Early Paper Money of America p. 53). Note that on the fractional bills the dots in the corners of the front design reflect the denomination, with one dot designating a sixth of a dollar, two dots for a third, three dots for $1/2 and four dots for $2/3. Also, fractional denominations come in plates A, B and C. Again it was Newman who discovered tat the devices and border designs for the fractional bills were cut by Elisha Gallaudet, who also designed the Continental Currency coin. There is one signer, in red ink, on the fractional bills and two signers, using red and brown ink, on the dollar denominations. Counterfeit detectors for the dollar denominations were made on blue paper. The Franklin designs were adopted for the Continental Currency coin made a few months later and for the 1787 Fugio cents. The paper, made at Ivy Mills in Chester County, Pennsylvania, contained blue fibers and mica flakes. Printed by Hall and Sellers in Philadelphia. Denominations printed were the: $1/6, $1/3, $1/2, $2/3, $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7 and $8.</scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>419</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="Benjamin Brannan">Signer: Benjamin Brannan (or Brannon) (in red ink). </persname></origination><unittitle label="$1/6">One Sixth Dollar368246

This is the most difficult emblem in the series to understand. Benjamin Franklin explained the Continental Currency emblems in a letter published under the pseudonym of Clericus in the Pennsylvania Gazette of September 20, 1775. For the five dollar emblem he explained: ...we have a thorny bush, which a hand seems attempting to eradicate. The hand appears to bleed, as pricked by spines. The motto is, SUSTINE VEL ABSTINE; which may be rendered, Bear with me, or let me alone; or thus, Either support or leave me. The bush I suppose to mean America, the bleeding hand Britain. Would to God that bleeding were stopt, the wounds of that hand healed, and its future operations directed by wisdom and equity; so shall the hawthorn flourish, and form an hedge around it, annoying with her thorns only its invading enemies.

The issue is similar to that of July 22,1776 with some modifications. The ornament and type fonts for the back of the bills was modified. Also, this was the first issue to use the legend "THE UNITED STATES" replacing the former designation as the United Colonies. Because of extensive British counterfeiting the bills were recalled for an exchange on January 2, 1779 (compare our examples of an original and a counterfeit $8 bill below). However, new bills were not always available and the recall needed to be extended to January 1781! By that date the bills were almost worthless because of hyperinflation (in January 1781 $1 in specie traded for $75 continental in most states, while in Maryland it took $110 continental dollars and in North Carolina $210 continental dollars to obtain $1 in specie).

The nature print on the back, though indistinct, is of henbit and two buttercups. This bill is a counterfeit, one of two different counterfeits from engraved copperplate described by Newman. Distinguishing marks noted by Newman and described in the official broadside are the following: (1) the base of the 'I' in "MINORIBUS" is high, (2) the baseline of the harp rises to the right instead of being horizontal, (3) words in the text are too short, and (4) the 'O' and 'E' in "CONGRESS are low. and can be distinguished from the original by the finer line of the engraved border cuts and emblem and darker paper. Other differences include the following: (1) the 'V' which appears just after "EIGHT" in the lower portion of the left border cut is linked to the script in the original but is separate in the counterfeit; (2) the stems of the three 7s in "1777" on the back form a descending diagonal in the counterfeit but a straight line in the original.

This issue is known as the Yorktown issue. Because of the extensive counterfeiting discovered in the May 20, 1777 issue, this issue included new engraved border cuts on the obverse and on the reverse newly redesigned letter type, typeset ornaments, border designs and new nature prints. Also, because of inflation, denominations below $4 were eliminated and $20 and $40 notes were added. Even with the new designs there was extensive counterfeiting so that these bills were included in the January 2, 1779 recalled mentioned above in the May 20, 1777 issue. Also, this was the first issue which was not even accepted at face value by the Continental Congress at the date of issue. By April of 1778 the Congress officially valued the currency at $2.01 in Continental dollars for $1 in specie. The devaluation of continental currency had begun in most states as early as January 1777, by April of 1778 in some states the exchange was as high as $6 continental to $1 specie. Printed by Hall and Sellers who moved to Yorktown with the Congress from September 30,1777 - June 27, 1778. The paper, made at Ivy Mills in Chester County, Pennsylvania, contained blue fibers and mica flakes. Detector bills were printed on blue paper.

The nature print on the back depicts three arrows. Paper contains blue threads and mica flakes. The bill displayed here is an early variant of this particular counterfeit. The first issues were distributed with the comma missing after the word Philadelphia in the main text. This was soon publicized so the counterfeiters corrected the unissued bills in ink and inserted a comma into their typeset so the later part of their printing included the comma. Also the ascender in the letter h in 26th broke in the later stages of the printing. Our example is missing the comma and has a complete h. (for a late variant of this counterfeit see Newman, third edition, p. 459). Other variations that distingish this issue from legal bills are as follows: In the first line of the text the word "to" is slightly lower than the other words. In the word "according" the second letter c is higher than the first letter c. Also in the bottom line of text in the word "DOLLARS" the top loop of the letter S is not attached to the remainder of the letter.

Also in the next to the last line of text the long s (that is the first s) in the word Congress has a very short top curve so that the end of the letter points upwards while on official notes the curve on that s is more pronounced and the end of the letter points downwards.</scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform>3 o'clock</genreform></controlaccess><acqinfo>EANA mail bid auction 04/20/96 lot 403.

Benjamin Franklin explained the Continental Currency emblems in a letter published under the pseudonym of Clericus in the Pennsylvania Gazette of September 20, 1775. For the five dollar emblem he explained: ...we have a thorny bush, which a hand seems attempting to eradicate. The hand appears to bleed, as pricked by spines. The motto is, SUSTINE VEL ABSTINE; which may be rendered, Bear with me, or let me alone; or thus, Either support or leave me. The bush I suppose to mean America, the bleeding hand Britain. Would to God that bleeding were stopt, the wounds of that hand healed, and its future operations directed by wisdom and equity; so shall the hawthorn flourish, and form an hedge around it, annoying with her thorns only its invading enemies.

The Massachusetts General Court had authorized an emission of &#xE03;10,000 in lower denominations notes of 1s-20s, dated October 14, 1713, prior to an act of November 13, 1713, that recalled previous issues of 3s6d and 10s notes due to extensive counterfeiting. Two copperplates were engraved, one plate for the 12d, 1s6d, 24d and 2s6d denominations and another plate for the 3s, 5s, 10s and &#xE03;1 issues. About four months later, on March 26, 1714, another emission of &#xE03;30,000 was authorized in anticipation of a June 25, 1714 act to exchange old notes.  A new higher denomination copperplate was engraved for the 1714 emission, containing 30s, &#xE03;2, &#xE03;3 and &#xE03;5 issues.  These three plates, the low and middle denomination plates from 1713 and the higher denomination plate of 1714, continued to be reused and redated for subsequent Massachusetts emissions through 1740.    In 1736, two emissions were authorized that made use of the existing copperplates. During the first 1736 session of the General Court an act was passed on July 6 granting the governor &#xE03;3,000 in bills of public &#xE32;to enable him to go on managing the publick affairs.&#xE33; [Acts and Resolves, Public and Private, of the Province of the Massachusetts Bay, vol. 2, p. 793] Then, during the second session, an act was passed on February 4, 1736/7, to supply the treasury with &#xE03;18,000 &#xE32;in the present form and tenor&#xE33; as well as &#xE03;9,000 &#xE32;in bills of credit of a new form&#xE33; [that is, &#xE03;18,000 from the older plates in what is now called first new tenor (or middle tenor) notes and &#xE03;9,000 from newly cut plates in what is now called second new tenor (or new tenor) notes.  [Acts and Resolves, vol. 2, pp. 814-27].  Massachusetts currency dated 1736 may have been authorized by either the act of July 6 or the act February 4.  The lower left corner of each denomination displays the English shield of three lions with the French motto HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE (Evil to him who thinks evil) surmounted by the coronet of the Prince of Wales. On each denomination the main text is framed in a different design, except the &#xE03;5 note, which is not framed. The design of the indent border differs for each denomination.</scopecontent><odd>MA 1736- Middle Tenor</odd><controlaccess><genreform>American Colonial</genreform></controlaccess><c02><did><unitid>599</unitid><origination><persname role="signer" normal="A.

Also, just below the main text the redatings of 1733 and 1735 have been lost due to holes in the paper, only an initial 17 of the date 1733 is visible. On the far right end of that line the numbers 36 remain, this is from the final redating on this note, namely 1736. The plate that produced this issue was later reused once again in 1740. The 1740 date was added below the central frame, just to the right of the crown on the royal seal. Fortunately, that portion of this specimen is intact and 1740 date is not present, thus we can conclude the specimen was printed for one of the two emissions in 1736.The central text reads:  [THIS INDENTE]D  Bill of Two shillings [and six pence due from t]he Province of ye Massachysets [B]ay in New England to the Possessor thereof shall be in [V]alue equal to Money And shall be accordingly [a]ccepted by the Treasurr &amp; Receivers subordinate to [hi]m in all Publick payment and for any Stock at [any time] in ye Treasury Bo[st]on Octobr ye f[ourteenth 1713] By Order of [the Great and General Court or Assembly].  The text is framed in a six-sided border, consisting of two right angles on the right side and a three-sided border on the left.  Only a small fragment of the upper margin indent design remains on the top right. The signatures are quite similar to those on a one-shilling Massachusetts note of 1735 illustrated in Eric Newman, The Early Paper Money of America, fifth ed., 2008, p. 191.Serial Number: quite faded, possibly 497</scopecontent><odd></odd><controlaccess><genreform></genreform></controlaccess><acqinfo></acqinfo><daogrp><daoloc href="MA_1736_10_14_2s6d.front"/><daoloc href="MA_1736_10_14_2s6d.back"/></daogrp></c02><daogrp><daoloc href=""/></daogrp></c01>
